## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS Media Query

### What I learned

I learnt about overlay background and respective CSS properties. Along with this, I learnt using JS Media Query to make the site more responsive and dynamic.

### Continued development

I still have to work on the navigation menu for mobile viewport width.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped in dealing with the background position and dropdown menu in navigation bar.
